VillageCP is the best self-hosted Minecraft server donations alternative. We aim to make collecting server donations as easy and hands-free as possible.

##You're in control.
VillageCP is self-hosted, meaning that you download and install the software on your own server. This is to the users advantage as they have full control over their donations and the software. You don't have to pay any monthly fees, or give someone else part of your donations. Thats what makes VillageCP awesome!

##Open Source!
If you don't like a feature, or want something added in, feel free to modify the software yourself. Or if you find a bug, you can patch it yourself and not have to wait on someone else to fix it and make an update.

Best of all? Its free.
